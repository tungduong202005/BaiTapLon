        <h2>What is C?</h2>
        <p>C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language that serves as the foundation for many modern languages. It was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. Known for its efficiency and flexibility, C has become a staple in system software, operating systems, and embedded systems.</p>

        <h2>Key Features of C</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple and efficient:</strong> The language is easy to understand and executes efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Rich library support:</strong> C provides numerous built-in functions and operators for various tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-level access:</strong> It allows direct manipulation of hardware and memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Code written in C can be easily compiled and run on different machines.</li>
            <li><strong>Structured programming:</strong> Encourages breaking a program into reusable functions for better organization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of C</h2>
        <p>C plays a critical role in numerous domains, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Many OS kernels, like Linux, are written in C.</li>
            <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Utilities, compilers, and interpreters are often built with C.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> C is widely used in microcontroller programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Many games and engines rely on C for performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> Popular systems like MySQL use C as their foundation.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Sample C Code</h2>
        <p>Below is a simple program to print "Hello, World!" in C:</p>
        <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p>This code demonstrates the basic structure of a C program, including headers, the main function, and standard output.</p>
